# internet-bookstore

Windows Forms application made in object-oriented C# simulating the operation of an online bookstore - adding products, deleting, displaying, sorting, writing and reading from/to a file. During its development, I learned how to create object-oriented applications using: abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, among others.
